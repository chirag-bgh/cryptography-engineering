### Ch 1

Q10. Describe a concrete example where improving the security of a system against one type of attack can increase the likelihood of other attacks.
Solution:

Consider the example given in ยง. Suppose that we have an office building where none of the office doors are locked every night. And also, the building has a false ceiling, i.e. you could lift up the ceiling panes and climb over any door or wall.

In this case, if an attacker wanted to gain access to a specific office, they would have to avoid the security guard and just walk in to the office through its door. If we wanted to increase the security of the building by locking all the doors every night, this would increase the likelyhood for an attacker to climb through the false ceiling whereas previously, they would most likely just walk through the door.
